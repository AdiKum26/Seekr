# OpenAI Integration Setup 🤖

## 🚀 **Enhanced CV Parsing with OpenAI**

### ✅ **What's Been Added:**

   - ✅ Uses GPT-3.5-turbo for intelligent CV parsing
   - ✅ Extracts structured data (GPA, major, skills, experience, etc.)
   - ✅ More accurate than regex-based parsing
   - ✅ Handles complex CV formats

2. **Resume Viewer Component** (`src/components/profile/ResumeViewer.tsx`)
   - ✅ View uploaded resume text
   - ✅ Download resume as text file
   - ✅ Replace existing resume
   - ✅ Delete resume functionality
   - ✅ Expandable text preview

3. **Enhanced Profile Page**
   - ✅ Integrated resume viewer
   - ✅ Replace/delete resume options
   - ✅ Better user experience

## 🔧 **Setup Instructions:**

### 1. **Get OpenAI API Key**
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to "API Keys"
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. **Add API Key to Environment**
Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```bash
# Add this to your .env file
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. **Update CV Parser to Use OpenAI**
Replace the current CV parser with the OpenAI version in your ProfilePage:

```typescript
// In src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx, replace the import:
import { parseCVWithOpenAI } from '../utils/openaiParser';

// Then use it in your CV upload handler:
const parsedData = await parseCVWithOpenAI(file);
```
