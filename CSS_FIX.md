# 🔧 CSS Error Fix - RESOLVED

## ❌ **Issue Found:**
```
Error: The `border-border` class does not exist. If `border-border` is a custom class, make sure it is defined within a `@layer` directive.
```

## ✅ **Root Cause:**
In `src/styles/globals.css` line 17, there was an invalid Tailwind CSS class:
```css
@apply border-border;  // ❌ This class doesn't exist
```

## 🛠️ **Fix Applied:**
Changed the invalid class to a valid Tailwind CSS class:
```css
@apply border-gray-200;  // ✅ Valid Tailwind class
```

## 📁 **File Modified:**
- `src/styles/globals.css` - Line 17

## ✅ **Status:**
- **Server:** Running successfully on http://localhost:3000
- **CSS Compilation:** Working correctly
- **Hot Reload:** Active
- **Error:** Resolved

## 🎯 **How to Test:**

1. **Open Browser:** http://localhost:3000
2. **Check for:**
   - ✅ No error overlay
   - ✅ Page loads completely
   - ✅ All styles applied correctly
   - ✅ Components rendering properly

## 📝 **Note:**
The `border-border` class was likely a leftover from a different UI framework (like shadcn/ui) that uses CSS variables for borders. Tailwind CSS uses utility classes like `border-gray-200`.

**✅ Application is now fully functional!**
